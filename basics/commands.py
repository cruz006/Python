#   this file will contain most of the commands 
#   that are needed when learning python

#   loops are useful, there are FOR loops and WHILE loops
#   this while loop repeats each time  until greater
#    than 10, and prints each update
var1 = 0
while var1 < 10:
    var1 += 1
    print(var1)
    print("\n")

#   this FOR loop is similar
var2 = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
for  a in var2:
    print(a + "\n")
    

#   this for loop prints all numbers between 1 and 10. 
for i in range(1,10):
    print(i)
    print("\n")


#   this is a type command, which is used to check 
#   the type of an object in your code. 
#   when you print it, it will show you which class the object is
my_str = "Why hello there\n"
print(type(my_str))

my_int = 5
print(type(my_int))

cnum = 3 + 2j
print(type(cnum))

rnum = 3.14
print(type(rnum))
print("\n")


#   this is the input command, where it takes your input
#   then, it prints your input
var3 = input("Hello, your name is: \n")
print("Hello there " + var3 + "\n") 

var4 = input("Pick any number: \n")
print("The number you said is " + var4 + ", correct?\n")


#   the len command checks the length of anything
#   the str command here is used to make the length(an interger),
#   into a string to be able to print it
var5 = input("Type anything you want here: \n")
print("What you typed is " + str(len(var5)) + " characters long.\n")


#   the str string can be used for many uses
var6 = 1000
print("This is an example of turning var6 into a string: \n" + str(var6))

#   the next examples will be capitalization
var7 = "hello"
print("\n" + var7.capitalize() + "\n")

#   now it will return the lower case word
var8 = "HELLO"
print(var8.lower() + "\n")

#   next is the center command
str = "Hello, this is in the center"
new_str = str.center(50, "*")
print(new_str + "\n")
