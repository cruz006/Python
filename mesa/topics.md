# Your guide to the coding solutions, eh

**Math operators**: Python supports the standard mathematical operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The modulo operator % can be used to find the remainder of a division operation.

---

**User input/output:** The input() function is used to get user input. It reads a line from input, converts it into a string and returns it. The print() function is used to display output.

---

## Control and conditional statements:

- **if, elif, else**: These are used to make decisions based on conditions.
  
- **while:** This is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
  
- **for:** This is used to iterate over a sequence (that is either alist, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string)

---

## Loops, iterations, and nesting:

- **break:** This keyword is used to exit a loop prematurely.
    continue: This keyword is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and continue with the next.
    Nested loops: Loops can be nested inside other loops.

---

## Boolean Algebra:

 - **and:** Returns True if both operands are true, otherwise returns False.
  
- **or:** Returns True if at least one of the operands is true, otherwise returns False.
  
- **not:** Returns True if the operand is false, otherwise returns False.

---

## Lists:
- Lists are ordered and mutable.
- Lists can contain elements of different data types.
- Lists can be indexed and sliced.

## Functions and user-defined functions:

- Functions are defined using the def keyword.
- Functions can accept arguments and return values.
- Functions can be called by their name followed by parentheses.

---

## Arithmetic:

- Addition: 
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (returns a float)
- Floor division (returns an integer)
- Modulo (returns the remainder of the division)
- Exponentiation

 **Order of operations:** Python follows the mathematical convention of performing arithmetic operations in the following order: Parentheses -> Exponentiation -> Multiplication and Division (from left to right) -> Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

## Evaluating Expressions and Equations:

- Python uses the eval() function to evaluate expressions.
- Python uses the solve() function from the sympy library to solve equations.

## Properties of equalities and inequalities:

- **Reflexivity:** For all real numbers x, x = x.
  
- **Symmetry:** For all real numbers x and y, if x = y, then y = x.
  
- **Transitivity:** For all real numbers x, y, and z, if x = y and y = z, then x = z.
  
- **Additive identity:** For all real numbers x, 0 + x = x.
  
- **Multiplicative identity:** For all real numbers x, 1 * x = x.
  
- **Additive inverse**: For all real numbers x, there exists a real number -x such that x + (-x) = 0.
  
- **Multiplicative inverse:** For all non-zero real numbers x, there exists a real number y such that x * y = 1.
  
- **Zero property:** For all real numbers x, x * 0 = 0.
  
- **One property:** For all real numbers x, 1 * x = x.
  
- **Trichotomy law:** For all real numbers x and y, exactly one of the following is true: x < y, x = y, or x > y.
  
- **Inequality reversal:** If x < y, then y > x.
  
- **Inequality transitivity:** If x < y and y < z, then x < z.
  
- **Inequality addition:** For all real numbers x, y, and z, if x < y and y < z, then x < z.
  
- **Inequality multiplication:** For all real numbers x, y, and z, if 0 < x and 0 < y, then 0 < x * y.
  
- **Inequality with zero:** For all real numbers x, if x > 0, then x * 0 > 0.
  
- **Inequality with one:** For all real numbers x, if x > 0, then x * 1 > 0
